A project suitable for college use.
An app to help football team managers to add,view,remove players in the team and new applicants can enter their details. 
All the data collected from the new applicant will be saved in an csv file.
The data of the existing members of the team will be saved into a MySQL database.

The app stays interactive due to the use of PyFiglet to add some graphical element.
